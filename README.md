Inventory Management System
Command Line Based – Python & SQLite

1. Introduction : 
The Inventory Management System is a command-line based mini project developed using Python and SQLite. It
manages categories, products, suppliers, stock, transactions, and reports.

2. Objectives : 
To efficiently manage inventory data, Aalise the products in the basis of demand track stock movement, perform CRUD operations,
 and generate/export reports.

4. Technologies Used :
Python, SQLite, SQL queries, Object-Oriented Programming, and basic file handling.

6. System Architecture :
The project follows a modular architecture with separate modules for database handling, users, categories,
products, suppliers, stock, and reports.

8. Database Tables :
Users, Categories, Products,Suppliers, Stock, and Transactions tables are used to store data.

6. User Roles :
Admin users can manage inventory and generate reports, while staff users can view products and stock.

7. Features :
Category management, product management, supplier management, stock in/out, transaction tracking, demand
analysis, and report generation.

9. Demand Analysis :
Products are analyzed based on sales and stock levels and classified as High, Medium, or Low demand.

9. Reports :
The system generates stock reports and transaction reports in tabular format and exports them to a text file.

10. OOP Concepts Used :
Encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design are applied throughout the project.

11. Exception Handling :
Exceptions are handled for invalid inputs, database errors, and file operations.

12. Limitations :
The system is command-line based and does not include password encryption or multi-user concurrency

13. Future Enhancements :
GUI or web interface, password hashing, PDF/CSV export, and cloud database support.

14. Conclusion :
This project demonstrates a real-world inventory workflow using Python and SQLite with a clean, modular, and
scalable design.
